HELP USING C# PROGRAM FOR CLANG PROJECT CREATOR v 1.0 - www.karadev.net


11.2023 - ADD main.bat file to run main.exe with stay open window in CMD
11.2023 - BUG FIXES, add checkbox for open CMD in compiling time
11.2023 - ADD SUPPORT FOR C++ FILES. auto detect main.c or main.cpp and call compiler clang or clang++

==============================================================================

!!! IMPORTANT !!! if you have both files main.c and main.cpp rename one of them to use other

EXAMPLE using main.c : if you will use main.c file then rename main.cpp to main_NOT_USED.cpp

EXAMPLE using main.cpp : if you will use main.cpp file then rename main.c to main_NOT_USED.c

compiler will work by default with main.c. cut/rename from work folder main.c to use main.cpp or cut/rename main.cpp to use main.c 

download clang compiler from >> https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases
this programm will make check for clang.exe if is found in default folder. if is found all is green,
if not project buttons are disabled.

click on SHOW ALL /number/ ASSETS to open full list of releases files for all operatng systems.
for windows select :
LLVM-15.0.6-win32.exe - for 32 bit x86 windows
LLVM-15.0.6-win64.exe - for 64 bit x64 windows

version numbers of file may different for different versions of clang

you need to install also a VISUAL STUDIO CODE with C/C++ exteshion add to, because clang have not self C/C++ language files. clang is only a compiler and use others languages packages from
VISUAL STUDIO CODE or VISUAL STUDIO 2022+ to compile code of C/C++.

INSTALLATION of clang compiler is need to be done OR PROGRAM all buttons are disable !!!
default path instalation = C:\Program Files\LLVM
or
default path instalation = C:\Program Files (x86)\LLVM

programm will check if in this folder have a file with name clang.exe. if this file is not in one
of this folders all buttons are disabled !!!

!!! in start instalation select radio check to ADD CLANG TO ALL PATH FOR ALL USERS !!!

the way of use
A. copy and paste this program directly into a new directory where you will create a new project.
B. install the CLANG compiler on your working machine / computer /, not forgetting to check GLOBAL PATHS DURING COMPILER INSTALLATION !!!! a menu will appear in which the compiler installer will ask you whether to set a global path to the compiler for all users of the particular computer system. ANSWER YES!!!!
C. with the program NOTEPAD++ or other text editor, make and save a file named main.c .
D. run the clang compiler and press the COMPILE CLANG PROJECT button.
E. if all is well, a file named main.c should appear in your new project directory and automatically start your first C program.

1. THE PROGRAM WORKS ON ALL VERSIONS OF WINDOWS FROM XP TO WINDOWS 11
2. THE PROGRAM DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY ADVERTISING MATERIALS AND/OR OTHER COMPUTER SYSTEM-DAMAGED CODES OR COMMANDS
3. the text on the buttons shows which button is for what - what command the button executes in the program
4. RUN PROJECT button - the button will look for the already compiled file / main.exe /. if the file exists it will run it in the windows DOS console with the program you wrote and compiled previously.
5. RUN NOTEPAD++ button - the button will search for the NOTEPAD++ program startup file in its installed directory in C:\Program Files\Notepad++. if the program is installed correctly, the button will start the program directly, if you have not installed the program, an error message window will appear.
6. button COMPILE CLANG PROJECT - this button will compile your text file /main.c/ into an executable /main.exe/ file so that you can run the program in the Windows DOS console.
7. RUN CALCULATOR button - this button will start the standard calculator in Windows
8. HELP button - this button displays a new window with text content of the help information for the program
9. button OPEN PROJECT FOLDER - this button will open a DOS console directly in the directory of your project.
